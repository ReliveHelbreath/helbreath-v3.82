		Game server Settings 

Siementec used the WLserver to send settings to gservers, but
as HBx and others added features and settings to gservers,
a new way was needed to provide every gserver those new
settings. This is done using \GameConfigs\ folder.



         Settings.cfg file
¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯
	Many entries here are from HBx and quite simple to
understand. I'll detail entries added for EP: 


map-mode = EQUILIBRIUM, CLASSIC(default)

	In this mode, many game features are changed to suit the
Equilibrium Project map settings. This setting is not suited
for crusade times. We uselly reboot server before crusades.

Here a list of most important things changed:
- Recall Scroll or spells will TP you to Equilibrium instead
  of old cities.
- Can stay in enemy cities (including Shop/BS/WHTower...)
- Can Recall from enemy cities.
- PKillers go to Jail in maps around Equilibrium and no more
  in old cities.
- Dont go to Jail if dead in enemy city.
- Ares can party Elvine 
- Ares can resurect Elvine if in same party
- No Eggs or rare 2nd drops if random-mob 
- Area spells (FireWalls...) Forbiden in Equilibrium instead
  of old cities.
- Poison calls Guards in Equilibrium instead of old cities.
- Forced Recall goes to Equilibrium.
- Can get Quests from William outside old cities.



pvp-hp-mode = HIGH or LOW (default)

	HB uses Dext once for hitting bonus and Dext Twice for
defence. So PvP is hard for Warrior with high dext, and even
a 250 dext fencer can have hard time wounding a 150 Dext
character. With HIGH mode, the Defence is lowered for PvP only!
Lowering the defense gives a better advantage for low dext
chars using critic attacks than to dextis. So it was changed
also.

Things changed in game formulas: (only PvP)
- Defense changed from: 
  Armors + Dext x2 + defence items + Magic DefenceRatio
  to:
  Armors + Dext + defence items + Magic DefenceRatio/2
- Critical Attacks changed:
  +100 to hit bonus
  to:
  -50 to defence ratio of opponent (10 minima)
  Note that the over bonus to hit (0 to +30) depending
  on weapon type, is not changed.



alchi-item-upgrade  	= ON or OFF (defaut)
gizon-item-upgrade   	= ON or OFF (defaut)

Allows player to upgrade items directly from game interface
Either with Alchemy Oils, Elixirs and Balls; 
or gizon points...



xp-mode 			= EQUILIBRIUM (default), USA, or HB

 	I added this to choose the XP mode for the server. Three
modes can be choosen:
- HB (0)  is standard Helbreath XP 
  (bonus up to level 80, reduced in farms above lvl 80)
- USA (1) as on HB-USA, gives huge XP bonusses up to lvl 120.
- EQUILIBRIUM (2) is my standard:
  - bonus up to lvl 120 instead of 80, no malus in farms at high levels
  - malus for 10 max levels of the server (ie: 140 -> 150 (2% per level)
  - XP20% weapons are counted AFTER the party XP sharing.



party-log 			= VERBOSE or STANDARD (default)

	To debug Party problems, I implemented a very complete Party-log.
But such a big log can introduce some lag, on populated server, so
I introduced a way to enable/disable it.



absolute-max-player-level = 153

	As I introduced gizon to gain some extra levels, I needed to set
this somewhere. The max level is set in npc.cfg (world-server-max-level),
but the absolute max level you can obtain with gizons is set here.
The cost is 4 gizons per level above the max level.
ie: if world-server-max-level = 150, 
    lvl151 will cost 4 gizons, 152 cost 8, 153 cost 12... 



evil-max-player-level   = 170

	The Evil characters, or Executors, can PvP almost everywhere.
(defined by "character-location   = evil") They are intended only to
be Abaddon's friends and should be reserved to few players (maybe
paying for that with 3 gizons). 
They are set manually by admin.
Those character could be a too heavy threat for lower levels, and could
be overpowerfull, so I needed to restrain their level possibilities.
They have special Armors (set special-event-id = 666, to have the
server give them those items) they have -500 reputation, and no access
to stated items.



show-city-power		= 1 (0 is default)

	The gserver window shows player/npc activiy, with this setting, 
it'll show relative strenths.
Note that the Key [F2] can toggle modes...



killer-indicator		= 0(default), 1, 2

	Sends a killed client a message to tell him who killed him.
0: No message (default)
1: Message unless crusade time
2: Message even at crusade time



heldenian-war-time 	= 15  (default)
heldenian-end-time 	= 105 (default)
heldenian-summon	 	= 0(default), 1, 2

	Set values for war beginning afet event's start, and 
total event's duration. (in minutes)
	Set summon control type. 
-0: summons don't survive master
-1: summons survive master and wait for master return forever.
-2: summons survive and can be mobilized by anybody (/mobilize)



primary-drop-rate 	= EQUILIBRIUM or 1~10000
secondary-drop-rate 	= EQUILIBRIUM or 1~10000
gold-drop-rate 		= EQUILIBRIUM or 1~10000
rep-drop-modifier	 	= 2

	I changed and extended the drop rate modifiers.
Primary drop rate is chances of not dropping something:
- 0 would mean npc always drop
- 6500 HBX default
- 7750 or 9000 for v2.191 server (I don't know witch reason lowers drop rate)
- 8670 for REVIVAL server (Lower because Gold proportion is reduced later)
- 8720 for EQUILIBRIUM server (same as REVIVAL for character with 100 reputation)
  With Reputation adjustement, will be 8220 (19% droprate) to 9220(8% droprate)

Gold drop rate is chances to get gold
- 0 means only drops, never gold
- 6000 HBX defaut 
- 6500 on v2.191 server
- 3000 for EQUILIBRIUM server ( because too much Gold in HB)

Secondary drop rate is chances to get som potion as 2nd drop,
instead of some stated item (weapons wands, armors or shields)
- 0 means only items never potions
- 9000 HBX default (was stronglly adjusted for reputation)
- 9000 on v2.191 server
- 7800 for Equilibrium Project 
  (more items, because less total drops)

	Reputation drop modifier was introduced by HBX to adjust 
the secondary drop rate only. But the effect was hudge with very
high reputation. I changed this to affect primary drop rate,
and to a lesser extend. 
	The primary drop rate is modified by the 1/2 per reputation
point. The rep-drop-modifier acts as as multiplicator of reputation
points. The maximum effect is +-500 on primary drop rate.
(This is still a nice increase, provided the low drop rate
on Equilibrium project)




      Crusade.cfg file
¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯
	 I added a function to change mana stone number in ML.

stone-number = -1
// 0 means default (3), -1 means random (1..5)




      AdminSettings.cfg file
¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯
	This file defines the required AdminUserLevel for many
Admin commands. As I added many new commands, they needed to be
either linked to an already existing entry, or to a new entry.

	To have more understandable Adminlevels, I designed 
GM functions as below:
Admin_1: Spectator ( unvulnerable, with very few rigths...)
Admin_2: Policeman ( can ban, watch, kill...)
Admin_3: Event organizer ( can summon, change map settings...)
Admin_4: Full rights (can create items start Crusade or Apocalypse...)
Admin_5: Programmer (can as well start/stop servers...)
Admin_-1: Spectator that can start a server...


Admin-Level-/setpkmode				= 3
Admin-Level-/setmaptype				= 3
Admin-Level-/readmapinfo			= 2
Admin-Level-/setmapmobnum 			= 3
Admin-Level-/popoenabled 			= 3
Admin-Level-specialevents			= 4

	Added new entries, with standard settings.



      TeleportList.cfg file
¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯
	Client v3.51 is able to teleport you to various places
from CityHall or CommanderHall. The CityHall possible places
list must be provided to gserver. Find below a sample:

[TELEPORT-DESTINATION-LIST]
//--------N°-WhoGives---FomWhere----To-----------X---Y------Price-MinMaxLvl---ForWho-Civ-Trav-Crim  
//                    Map's Location
teleport = 1 William	lost 		dglv2 	263 258 	3000 	20  250 	aresden 	0 0 0 
teleport = 2 William	lost 		dglv2 	209 258 	3000 	20  250 	elvine 	0 0 0 
teleport = 3 William	aresden	dglv2 	263 258 	3000 	20  250 	aresden 	0 0 0 
teleport = 4 William	elvine	dglv2 	209 258 	3000 	20  250 	elvine 	0 0 0 
teleport = 5 William	lost 		middleland 	393 265 	2000 	81  250 	heldenian  	0 0 0 
teleport = 6 William	lost 		BtField	-1  -1 	8000  81  250 	heldenian   0 0 0 
teleport = 7 William	lost 		2ndmiddle	-1  -1 	300   20  100 	all   0 0 0 
teleport = 8 William	lost		toh2 		-1  -1 	5000 	100 250 	all 	0 0 0 
[END]




         gserver.cfg file
¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯
build-date = 1126

	I added Build date for Gate server matching, sould someone
discover a way to hack using gate.




    Anti-Hack in Settings.cfg file
¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯
validation-number		= 0 (0 prevents the system from working)

	This is a "key" system designed to check for the validation number
on all character files. This is an anti-hack function. Should a hacker
connect a gserver to your main/world servers to introduce edited characters,
they would lack the right validation umber and would be rejected and logged.
	Note that the Extasis ready to use hack will recover the character file
with the key, so the validation number is obsolete. A new protection have
been added to the Wserver.

MSGID_REQUEST_REGISTERGAMESERVER = 67896789

	This a way to protect against the extasis hack. This feature changes
MSGID used to register the game server to the world server. The MGSID
must also be fixed in the wserver to match the gserver.


validation-crc1		= 0
validation-crc2		= 0
	A good way to protect from hacked or memory patched clients is to ask
the client to auto-check his own CRC and send it to server for checking. 
Currentlly no function have been coded to cry havok on modifyed clients,

as needed.

¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯
	The system has been clarifyed, to group most
commands for some specific GM's tasks.
1: Basic GM with very few commands (only /tp)
2: Police GM, for player monitoring.
3: Event GM, to organize misc. events.
4: Admin GM, can create items, and set crusade, apoc, Heldenian.
-1: Speciaml technical GM, may start a server from another running
server, usefull is a server crashed, and hoster not available to
restart it.
5: AdminGM + Technical GM.

	Some command have been grouped into AdminSettings.cfg
entries. The need for "/enableadmincommand XXXX" is now more 
logic.

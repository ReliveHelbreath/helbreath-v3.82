		EP Anti-hack features

Equilibrium Project server is  based on HBX2.24b sources,
but many things have been fixed and improved. Specially
Anti-Hack features from Siementec were very poor, and 
even if HBX introduced some fixes for various hacks, 
many things were still open for the wouldbe hacker.



       Anti-Hack features
¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯

	I added numerous anti-hack features to server. Some 
anti-hack function already coded where improved or completelly 
written anew.
	All hack attempts or suspitions will be logged in HackEvents.log.
Some important events will even be shown in red on server's window.

	Note than some hack suspictions maybe caused by lagging
clients. Depending the hack certitude, the possible hack maybe 
only prevented, the probable hack may disconect the character,
the sure hack will seem to disconnect the character for the hacker,
but keep the character on game a few more seconds to prevent using
this hack as an emergency disconnection.

	Here is a list of Hacks detected or prevented:
- TradeHack impossible.
- SpeedHack could only be used for very short period,
  but most certainlly be detected.
- Move or Swing speeders.
- PrecastHack, CastHack.
- DisconectionHack
- DashHack, SwingHack, FullSwingHack.
- FlyHack (some false alarms here)
- ExtasisHack prevention.
- Edited Client prevention & detection.
- HBHax351 double protection and detection.
  (client side, and server side when applicable)
- Generic Memory patcher detection.
- Abnormal rich players detection.
- Abnormal high XP detection.
- Abnormal situations detection.
- ResurectionHack prevention.
- Dupe item processing improved.
- Packet editor attack detection.
- Packet editor to up skills prevention.
- DOS attack detection and logging.

	Many anti-hack functions are based on client patches
linked to gserver's functions. Siementec made many mistakes
with hack prevention, and some could be fixed simply by
fixing the client's exe.



     For Settings.cfg file
¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯

validation-number		= 0 (0 prevents the system from working)

	This is a "key" system designed to check for the validation number
on all character files. This is an anti-hack function. Should a hacker
connect a gserver to your main/world servers to introduce edited characters,
they would lack the right validation umber and would be rejected and logged.
	HBMaster can be used to set the number for existing server characters.

	Note that the "Extasis ready to use hack" will recover the character
file with the key, so the validation number is obsolete. A new protection
have been added to the Wserver.


MSGID_REQUEST_REGISTERGAMESERVER = 12345678

	This a way to protect against the extasis hack. This feature changes
MSGID used to register the game server to the world server. The MGSID
must also be fixed in the wserver to match the gserver.


validation-crc1		= 0
validation-crc2		= 0
	0: don't use, other: expected WORD values (ascending order)
	A good way to protect from hacked or memory patched clients is to ask
the client to auto-check his own CRC and send it to server for checking. 
Currentlly no function have been coded to cry havok on modifyed clients,



connection-check-time	= 8000 (0 is defaut)

	The client sends a connection check on a regular basis (8 seconds 
or 8+1 seconds) the server can use this value to detect edited clients, 
packet senders, speedhacks, etc... If you change this value in client
change as well here!



         New GM commands
¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯

/monitor CharName
	I implemented special anti-hack routines. GM can activate them
on suspect character. A file will be created that logs every action
of this character. 
	Beware this files grow very fast, and the character will no suffer
from his possibles hacks.(no prevention disconection, only logging)
	Can be used only on one character on a gserver at once. Use the 
command without CharName to stop the logging.


/getactivegservers"space"
	Any very important server event (shown in red on the server
window) is shown to a GM with this command.
 




   Hack-like included features
¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯

	Some "hack-type" features have been included in EP
for everybody to use:
- Multi-client.
- 5 shortcuts keys (F1 F2 F3 F11 F12)
- Removed Badwords filtering.
- Shows small trees in Medium detail level.

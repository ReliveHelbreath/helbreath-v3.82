				Items definitions   

Most information here was found and written by Snoopy81...
Some information is standard HB, some is EP specific addition.
Some InGame effects are given per Item number
HBx server, Siementec and client, often uses item sprite nbe, 
but EP server uses item number for InGame effects most of the time.

item.cfg, item2.cfg, item3.cfg:
¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯
	Those files have a size limit, it's not the number of items, but
the file's size. So, remove useless comments if applicable, replace
spaces by a single TAB, or use my patch to allow WLserver to send bigger
files.

	If one item file is too big, the server may show an error in some
other config file, seeminglly not related.

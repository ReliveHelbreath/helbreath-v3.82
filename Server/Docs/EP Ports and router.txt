				Ports & router 

You must forward some ports from hosting computer to the web, if you want
to host for both LAN & WAN from your LAN.

Used ports:
¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯
	When the client first contact the server, it calls the MLS ( checks
password & selects world). The IP & port are most often hard coded in the
client, but EP put them in the login.cfg file.
	
	Then the MLS gives the WLS IP & port to the client. The client
initiates a connection to the WLS. This server enable character selection,
and sends the clients the IP & Port of the Game server.
	This server is also used for some inter-game server connectivity;
and that's a safety issue.

	The Gate server is ONLY used for communication between Game servers,
along with the WLS. So Gate port never need to be forwarded (except if
multi-hosting)

	Each Game server use a port given to the client by the WLS.

	My server status detection system also uses some ports.

	The main issue with hosting both LAN & WAN players is that most
routers with forward WAN->LAN, but not LAN->LAN. When the client wants
to connect the Game server to the IP given by the WLS, it's the WAN IP.
If the router is not able the route this internal request to the right
internal comuter, it's not possible to play from LAN. That's the
reason I introduced the command:
		game-server-mode 		= LAN
in LOGIN.CFG. Using this will allow to host with virtually any router,
as asking the client to ignore the IP sent by WLS and use instead the
rigth IP.

	Note that MLS & WLS may use a range of 3 ports.

Forwarded ports:

Here the ports you need to forward:
- MLS (MainLog server): find in HMLServer.cfg
- WLS (World log server): find in WLserver.cfg ( not the internal ! )
- Gate: NEVER forward
- Game servers: find in gserver.cfg
- Status detection: Game server port + 20

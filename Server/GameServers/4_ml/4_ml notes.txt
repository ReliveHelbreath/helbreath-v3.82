TOH and IceBound
----------------------------------------
Game, history:

- Far away from Equilibrium city, those maps
totally escape to gods power.

- Close to ML, IB & TOH are left untouched
by Gods power.

- Abaddon took away three power stones in the
hope of using them to destroy the gods, resulting
in the collapse of TOH3.

- IB is designed as a very deadly map.
----------------------------------------
Tech: 

- ML pits here are of my design because as we tested
later the "officials" pits, we found them unbalanced,
and less chalenging. 

- Many HC pits can be found at ML, but random HC,
to prevent massive HC hunt.

- PL pit are of my design. They're very rich for a fast
XP up to lvl101. (Level limit is 100 at PL)

- TOH3 has been removed for 2 reasons:
1: It's possible to lure awy HC & GG from SW stone's pit, 
   giving players an easy DE pit. DE are supposed to be hard
   found (mainlly TOH1) and you must take care of other npc.
   So you cant kill thousands of DE, so XP & Drops are very nice.*
   A DE pit would give a real great advantage to those able to
   XP inside.
2: I needed to remove a map to show the Equilibrium Minimap.

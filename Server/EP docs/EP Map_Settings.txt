		Map definition
Some things have been fixed or improved, som new 
options added, and new commands added.

___________________________________
      PvP, Safe, drops
¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯
type = 0,1 -> added 2,3
	0 = normal 
	    (default)
	1 = NoPenalty NoReward
	2 = No PC Drop
	3 = No PC Drop, No EK, No PK

pk-mode = 0,1,2,3,4,5 -> new command as Patch by Sobame for serveur v2.191
pk-mode = -1,-2,-3,-4,-5
	0 = All EK & PK allowed 
	    (default)
	1 = EK allowed, but no PK
	2 = No PK, EK only available with Executors
	3 = No PK or EK possible (safe map)
	4 = No PK or EK possible (safe map),
	    but Executors can be victims.
	5 = No EK possible, but you may PK
	    (5 is not allowed in map definition, usable by GM)
negative values have same effect but apply to crims as well.


drop-type 	= 1 (default as normal Player drops)

	This setting will change chances to drop item on considered map.
Default is 1 (normal drops). 
2+ is not implemented and is considered same than 1.
-1 will only drop potions or food.
0 will drop nothing. 
This setting is taken into account at drop time, so after maps's type.


NB: GM can adjust those values in game:
/setmaptype 3
/setpkmode 4
/setdroptype 0

        Mobs generation
¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯
Added many things here: "Magic Pits", "Random Pits", 
				"Pits that attract spawns"


random-mob-generator	= 1 5

	The 1st number here can normally be 0 or 1. The 1 value is
standard, and 0 would mean non mob generated at all (still can be
used to force some pits in the map to have zerk mobs).
	I introduced the possibility to kill automatically some mobs
on the map, to generate some activity. (If the mob number is close
to the maximum possible, you can go in a small pit, and never kill
enougth mobs to lower the mob total number enougth to generate a big
spawn... ie: if you're alone at Dung2 at the clop pit, you'll never
be disturbed by a spawn!)
	This autamatic npc killing will not affect bigger than ogre npc,
and will take place just before big spawn time. Killed mobs will not
drop.
The number is a percent of total npcs to be killed. 
random-mob-generator	= 15 5, would mean kill 15% of npcs.



spot-mob-generator	= 1  9    159 21 200 55      13   5

	Initially HB allows Type 2 for WayPoint list (never 
seen that in use) or Type 1 for a pit.
	I added the possibility to add other types. They have the
effect too attract large spawns in this pit. 1/3 of all spawns
wiil take place in this pit, using the creature given by Type.
Type 1: sdr area SMG
     2: sdr waypoint (Random order)
     3: waypoints sequencial order
     4+ attracts spawns
     0-: "Magic Pit" special moving pit with ramdom mobs
NB: Mob type is not the same used by mog gen, but the one used
    in server for random-mobs. You may need to experiment! 
    ( Often same as npc.cfg, +100 forsometimes HC/TW/Wyv/FireW, 
    +200 for tougher mobs, 100+ for city mobs... )
NB: Mob type -1 will generated random Ogre, WW, clops, & rare others.
    ("Random Pit") Creature nbe is adjusted according creature might.


mobevent-amount  		= 30

	The number of mobs of a big spawn is fixed by server programmer.
The standard is 15, but this new command allows to change it per map.

      Apocalypse & Heldenian
¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯
Those events need special maps settings,
Few wer coded, so I added or coded needed
map settings.


RecallImpossible        = 1 or 0 (default)

	This setting will forbid any type of recall, scroll,
spell, BI tickets, 


not-permanent-map 	= 1 or 0 (default)

	This setting will recall any character trying to disconnect
from the current map. The Aim is prevent "lost" characters if the
player tries to connect later when the map is no more hosted.


ApocalypseMap 		= 1 or 0 (default)

	This setting will force recall players from map if
Apocalypse event is not running.

ApocalypseMobGenType	= 2, 1, 0 (default)
//------------------------NpcID---RECT---------
ApocalypseBossMob       = 73      49 186 70 207

	This setting prevents creatures spawning, as soon as 
Apocalypse event is started. the "2" means spawn the boss
when the map is empty.


//------------------------RECT-----------------TargetMap---TargetCoord
DynamicGateCoord		= 59 196 60 197        abaddon	   -1  -1
DynamicGateType		= 3, 2, 1

The dynamic Gate type 1 is openned 20 minutes when Apocalypse
start. It can be forced Open/Close by GMs.

The dynamic Gate type 2 is openned when map is empty, all npc
and boss spawned and killed.

The dynamic Gate type 3 is openned when map is empty, at the
same time the boss is spawned.

NB: If you want, you can create a subfolder \mapcrus\ and put
Crusade map-definition here; if you want to launch a crusade
from EQUILIBRIUM mode.

HeldenianMap  	= 1 or 0 (default)

	Used to detect if a map is used by Heldenian event, for various
tasks, such as spell limitations, summons, mob regens, Heldenian
contribution....

//-heldenianDoor---Direction---X----Y
HeldenianGateDoor  	3	 98	49
	
	Put the gates, area around is set impossible to cross. 
Only Dir 3 or 5 possible.

HeldenianWinningZone  	=	x	y

	Place GodH flag here.

//-Heldenian Tower ID ---------Side----------sX------sY
HeldenianTower  =  87            1           53      212

	Put Hedenian buildings, can as well put some crusade
buildings. Side is automatically computed for type 2.

¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯
¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯
initial-point = i x y
	When character is TP to -1 -1, he will go to fixed point if a point
of his side exists. Ares will go pt1, Elvine pt2, executors pt4. But random
points still apply to recall / forced recalls...


CitizenLimit		= 1 or 0 (default)

	This setting prevents civilians to enter the map.

            Event maps
¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯
Some Miceleanous settings here.

xp-rate = 100 (default)

	Gives a percentage for XP scored on this map. Normal is 100% xp,
200% is twice xp, 50% is half xp... GM can change this in game.


extra-drop = 7800 (1..10000)

	Changes the secondary drop rate for a map.
0 or negative have no effect. The stated drop rate replaces global one for this map.
NB: The lower secondary drop rate => the max items.


limited-cast = 0(default), 1

	Prevent from casting spell from category 1, as if in a
save area.


item-event = 1 Token2 	1	5	11	3	0	Plant Ogre Orc Zombie Scorpion EOL	
//item-event_=_index__itemName__amount__TotalNumber__month__day__type__mobList[Max:5]
	This feature is not coded in HBx server, and Siementec server
version was not complete and seemed buggy. Fixed.
NB: Will never gived stated items.


initial-point = i x y

	When character is TP to -1 -1, he will go to fixed point if a point
of his side exists. Ares will go pt1, Elvine pt2, executors pt4. But random
points still apply to recall / forced recalls...
	If you want no fixed point for a side, avoid this side in the list.


CitizenLimit		= 1 or 0 (default)

	This setting prevents civilians to enter the map.

			EP Economy

Many things have been fixed, improved, added.

¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯
* Gold drop rate: 
  Onstandard HB, gold is not an issue. Mobs drop often gold,
  and as it's based on mob's xp, increasing XPrate make 
  rich players.

* Demon, Liches 2nd drops:
  Removed by HBx, have been restorated. 
  (Liche are scarce, and DD often hunted with very 
  expensive weapons ie: Crystal Axe)

* EP Settings: 
  gold-drop-rate 		= EQUILIBRIUM or 1~10000
  Gold drop rate is chances to get gold
  - 0 means only drops, never gold
  - 6000 HBX defaut 
  - 6500 on v2.191 server
  - 3000 for EQUILIBRIUM server ( because too much Gold in HB)

* Item prices:
  Many item prices and durabilities have been adjusted,
  because useless items that drop often (small mobs) may
  be sold to BS for huge amounts of gold.
  Master items, are intended to be expensive to buy & repair.

* Traveller prices:
  As on standard HB, BS prices are 1/2 for potions.
  (Category 21..50)

* Lotery: Buy for 50k Lotos, and a chance for nice item.
  XP prices as well, statistically, you hope 1 xp per gold..

* Charisma price discount:
  On a high XP server, it's too easy to grow a "merchant"
  character with high charisma to buy everything half price.
  So the Charisma discount has been removed from client.

* Crusade/ Heldenian price discount:
  Not implemented on HBx server.
  Crusade is suposed to half prices for winers.
  Heldenian suposed to double prices for loosers.

* m_cDiscount:
  HBx server (as Siementec 2.20 sources) doesn't include
  the m_cDiscount, used by client. It's as a % the price
  difference for a single character.

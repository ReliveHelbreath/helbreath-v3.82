			Items for Equilibrium Project

EP introduces some items changes, and totally new items.
Some useless items have been removed.(Small swords & axes)


Items specially effects, not related to item's definition
¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯
	On HBx, some InGame effects are given per Item number, but many by
Item's sprite or other ways. As I added many new items with their
special abilities, I needed to have a better and clearer system. Most
items with special ingame effects are now designated by their number, 
so do not change them!


Client related changes:
¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯
	Client v3.51 have some strange PAK loading ways! AS I need no more
some smaller axes (useless as people grow fast to higher level). I patched
the client to my needs: 
Excalibur "shadows" bastard swd instead of scimitar (used for Druid class)

	Client v3.51, as older ones is quitte buggy for left hand items.
They show as weapons colours in the bag, but as item colours on the 
animation.I wrote a patch to fix the client for left hand items. They now
always use the same colour setings than weapons.

Weapon colors has also been fixed:            .
- Weapon n°1 (agile) diff from 2&3 
- Weapon n°15 added for Golden     
- Item color Black is darkned 



item.cfg, item2.cfg, item3.cfg:
¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯
	Those files have a size limit, it's not the number of items, but
the file's size. So, remove useless comments if applicable, replace
spaces by a single TAB, or use my patch to allow WLserver to send bigger
files.

	If one item file is too big, the server may show an error in some
other config file, seeminglly not related.


Removed useless items:

Weapons & armor balance:
¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯
	Originally HB has very unbalanced weapons, armors.
I tryed to fix that with minimal changes to original game,
but even Siementec needed to fix Weapon damages as the
game changed. This balance is computed to avoid players
to become rich too fast, so an inexpensive weapon can
be an advantage.

	The balance is really important, to allow characters
with many king of weapons to be still attractive. On EP
a Fencer is really powerfull even if useless at PvP.
GiSworder or Baxers are quite balanced and  208+ str 
ultra heavy wars or barbarians may deal tremendous damages
but must accept low Vit and/or Dext.



Manufacturing and enchantments:
¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯
	Manuf items can prove very powerfull if properlly
enchanted, and that's the reason not everything is available
to manuf.
ie: Helm is not available for manuf because it would provide
    Fencers with an easy magic item.

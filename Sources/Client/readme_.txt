___________________________________________________

This source is suposed to offer a client very 
close to v3.51; but the aim is not to have an 
exact copy. Some images, windows, texts may be 
slightly different!
The code is not always exactelly based on v351,
we sometimes used different ways to match a similar
result.
We also fixed some v351 bugs or issues.

The code has been cleared of most corean comments,
and some comments have been added, mostlly English
but some French comments survived!

Somes features has been added or fixed. You may use the
compilation options (see GlobalDef.h). 
They are commented!
Some very important data has been moved to this file as
well, such as server name, port, IP, version...

You may used the client with LOGIN.CFG to use a
dynamic IP.

Note that even if I already coded some new features for
this client, the aim of this sources is only to be as
close as possible to v3.51 official client. So, most 
of those extra features have been removed.

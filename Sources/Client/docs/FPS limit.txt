A friend have asked me to make a fps limit for him, maybe it is useful for somebody else.

It's pretty simple, inside void CGame::UpdateScreen(), replace:


CODE 	
case DEF_GAMEMODE_ONMAINGAME:
 UpdateScreen_OnGame();
 break;	


With:


CODE 	
case DEF_GAMEMODE_ONMAINGAME:
 //fps limit around 83
 if((G_dwGlobalTime - m_dwCurTime) > 12) UpdateScreen_OnGame();
 break;	


All you have to do, is divide 1000 (1sec) by the limit of fps you want (in that case, around 83) and change the "12" with that number.

Make a test with a "900".

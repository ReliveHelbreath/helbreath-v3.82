Dear Helbreath International Players,



1. General Idea of APOCALYPSE


According to dictional sense, meaning is ??the Book of Revelation??
By definition of Helbreath; it is the World behind the darkness.
The portal for the Apocalypse will be opened in Tower of Hell 3rd floor and Icebound.


2. Beginning of Apocalypse


The portal is generated at Icebound and Tower of Hell 3F

The portal is generated randomly. If the portal is opened, a message is shown at left-lower part. The period of opening is between 10 to 20 minutes. Once the portal is 
closed, players can not get into the map of Apocalypse. If some players fails to get into it, they should wait next chance. In other words, only the players, who enter the map 
of Apocalypse for regular time, can go toward the ABADDON.

Monsters are always generated around the portal.
Hellclaw and Gagoyle are generated. (in Tower of Hell 3F)
Ice Wyvern is generated. (in Icebound)



II. Stage to Stage : STS



The basic set up to move from stage to stage!

-1. In case of that players combat with monsters in the map and defeat them all(a kind of quest concept), players can move to next map. (Make sure all monsters in the map 
have to be gone.)

-2. Just go through the monsters in the map, and get into the portal for next map.

After entering in Apocalypse maps, players can not use a type of Recall spell (Bleeding Island Ticket included) and scroll. This rule is applied every map of Apocalypse equally.
Warning! In case of Disconnect (rebooting with a purpose included), players start in the town or farm. The regulation is same as Fight Zone. After the portal for Apocalypse is closed, players can not get into it at that time. For the next time, players, who can not get into, should wait and train hard.



Tower of Hell 3F, Icebound

Two places where the portal is opened.


Each map has one portal for Apocalypse.

From Druncnian City, players can choose a way between Infernia A and Infernia B The generation time of monsters is beginning of Apocalypse.
The number of monsters are fixed at the beginning, so no more monsters will be generated that players should clear up all monsters in the map. Similar kind of monsters are 
generated in both Infernia A and Infernia B.

There are two types of Castle Seize, Type 1 and 2. In Type1, Heldenian is in neural status, and any nation which destroys the other nation's Unit wins the battle and acquires 
Heldenian. In Type2, Heldenian is owned by one of the nations, thus there are defense (Nation who owns the Castle) and offense (Nation who wish to capture the Castle). 
Offending nation must get inside the castle and put their nation's flag inside Heldenian to win.

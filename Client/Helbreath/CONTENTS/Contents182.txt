Eldiniel, Aresien your names where 
peace, harmony, equilibrium...
 
Finally you made peace, but too late! 
 
Your power is weak...
May you protect people following you
in the ultimate shelter of Equilibrium

But hatred is srong and many continue
this stupid war, and Abaddon is every
day stronger!
